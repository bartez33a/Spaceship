# TODO - what's next

## My ideas:

- add detecting collision between rockets and base
- create slide to visualise loading ammo
- add few more weapons
- prevent generating meteors in spaceship's position
- increase size of spaceship?
- bound movement of spaceship
- decrease base HP when rocket hits base
- add option to save score and add database with best scores
- add menu e.g. for show best score, exit game
- create rockets as 3D model - model loading OpenGL
-  ???

DONE:
-  create rocket texture (DONE)
-  add detecting collision between meteors (DONE)
